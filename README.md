Mapping bathing water quality in the EU up until 2018. Data retreived from the [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/bathing-water-directive-status-of-bathing-water-11).

Made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Gatsby](www.gatsbyjs.org), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). Made during the academy program at [Sapera (formerly Infographics Group)](http://sapera.com/) in 2019.
